    <img src="pictures/main_picture.jpg" alt="Picture of family on hike.">
    <p>During the first two weeks of August 2016, my wife Claire and I, along with our two dogs Bailey and Cali, went on an amazing trip up and down the west coast.  We were able to see many of the great national parks that are our country's treasure.  We hope you enjoy looking through our trip and hopefully this helps you plan your own one day!</p>
