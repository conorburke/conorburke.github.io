    <p>First leg of or trip was heading up north from San Diego to Death Valley, and then up through Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming towards Yellowstone.  Death valley definitely deserves it's name as it was extremely hot and hardly anything growing there.  One really cool place was called the Devil's Golf Course.  Death Valley is below sea level.</p>

    <p>After surviving our first park, we headed to the Grand Canyon.  It was a foggy day but we did get a quick glimpse of the canyon.  Luckily, we had both seen it before.</p>
